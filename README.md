HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
DESCRIPTION:
The Hotel Booking Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate hotel reservation and management processes. It serves as a centralized platform where customers can search for hotels, view room availability, and make reservations. Additionally, hotel administrators can manage room inventory, track bookings, and handle customer check-ins and check-outs. The system aims to streamline hotel operations, enhance customer experience, and optimize room occupancy and revenue.
