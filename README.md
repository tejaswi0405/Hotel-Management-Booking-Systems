HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

DESCRIPTION:
The Hotel Booking Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate hotel reservation and management processes. It serves as a centralized platform where customers can search for hotels, view room availability, and make reservations. Additionally, hotel administrators can manage room inventory, track bookings, and handle customer check-ins and check-outs. The system aims to streamline hotel operations, enhance customer experience, and optimize room occupancy and revenue.

The Hotel Booking Management System, developed on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, emerges as a robust solution to address the intricate demands of modern hotel management. The Hotel Booking Management System aims to revolutionize the way hotels handle reservations, streamline customer interactions, and enhance overall operational efficiency. Leveraging the power of the MERN stack, this project seamlessly integrates a reliable database system, a responsive front-end, and a scalable back-end to create a comprehensive solution for hotel administrators and guests alike.
